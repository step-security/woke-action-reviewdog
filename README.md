## Usage

```yaml
name: woke
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  linter_name:
    name: runner / woke
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: step-security/woke-action-reviewdog@v0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # Change reviewdog reporter if you need [github-pr-check,github-check,github-pr-review].
          reporter: github-pr-review
          # Change reporter level if you need.
          # GitHub Status Check won't become failure with warning.
          level: warning
          # Enable this to fail the check when violations are found
          # fail-on-error: true
```

### Examples

#### `github-pr-review`

Details: <https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog#reporter-github-pullrequest-review-comment--reportergithub-pr-review>

This  reporter will create a PR comment with any violations found

```yaml
reporter: github-pr-review

# Uncomment this to cause the PR check to fail
# otherwise it will still post the comment on violations,
# but the PR check will succeed
fail-on-error: true
```

**NOTE** this reporter will not clean up duplicated comments from violations that
exist after multiple pushes. This can cause a lot of extra comments.
See <https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog/issues/568>

#### `github-pr-check`

Details: <https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog#reporter-github-checks--reportergithub-pr-check>

This reporter will create annotations in the "Checks" tab of the PR, but will not comment on
the actual PR. This is slightly better than `github-pr-review` as it doesn't clutter your
PR with comments, but you do have to go into the `Checks` tab to view issues.

```yaml
reporter: github-pr-check
```

Checks suite with annotations of violations

PR checks (both will fail on violation with `fail-on-error: true`)

### Filter mode

Details: <https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog#filter-mode>

By default, only `added` lines will cause reviewdog to annotate/comment on lines that have
been added in the PR. See above link for more options.
